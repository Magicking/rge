## Description

The NFT records a 128x24 pixel canvas with a unique [Truecolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_(24-bit))
It allows painting graffiti on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Paid in ETH, it uses the underlying token [ReapersGambit](https://reapersgambit.com/) for its birth and death mechanism.

### On-chain

Stored in the Ethereum Blockchain state, it lives forever rent-free (link to rent problem) along with the data of all the Ethereum mainnet RPC providers.

_Blessed be the free RPC providers_

### Dynamic

The unique rendering layer is EVM and thus requires the execution of the code of the [live contract](https://vscode.blockscan.com/ethereum/0x46d0d00e847ed9c2756cfd941e70d99e9152a22f); it pulls the state of the blockchain to render the image, changing on various criteria:
Who's viewing (msg.sender)
When it's displayed (RG alive status)
Block headers

It begins with the birth of the account, making it invisible to anyone except the owner for nine (9) days.

#### Ephemeral view

Every 15 seconds, the rendering of the artwork is slightly modified such that it is imperceptible without a few minutes' observation of a human but is different from the point of view of the digital worlds where it lives and relies on.

To retrieve the current view, a function called `token URI (NFT_ID)` with an `eth_call` to an Ethereum mainnet RPC provider at the latest block height must be made to render, encode, and return the graphic to view the NFT.

_Artifact living in its realm_

#### Futur updates

This project will also grow through upgrades as Ethereum evolves with the [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/).

### NFT

#### Rarity
 - 16777215 unique color available once.

 - Each drawing is the expression of a unique human touch.

 - Limited minting will last as long as there is enough [RG liquidity](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x8ab0ff3106bf37b2db685aafd458baee2128d648).

#### Tokenomics

 - 80% goes to the RG DAO Multisig; the funds buy back RG tokens and put them back as liquidity to the [RG/WETH](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x8ab0ff3106bf37b2db685aafd458baee2128d648) pair on Uniswap v2.

 - 20% goes as an artist commission.

## User Interface

 [Pixel Art Paint Decentralized Application](https://github.com/Magicking/nft-epitaph-front) (dApp)

 It is a retro terminal-themed web application that allows you to paint and visualize the epitaph.

#### Artwork

##### Gift

This project is a gift to the RG holders through the DAO.

##### Rebirth

Almost no activities, to a down capital; there should be a bump each time there is a mint.

##### Inscriptions

A project that allows users to inscribe an NFT with its emotions, stealing a bit of time and soul.

##### Prior work

It's based on the Reaper's Gambit project, as it allows for dead accounts to be honored with style.

It comprises a set of smart contracts and a [web interface](https://github.com/Magicking/nft-epitaph-front); no third-party hosting is required to see the NFT, making it resilient to nuclear wars.
